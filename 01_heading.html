  Components of a Computer
  
  A computer consists of various components that work together to process data and perform tasks. Below are the main components of a computer:

  1. Input Devices
     Input devices allow users to provide data and control signals to the computer.
      
     Examples of Input Devices:
        - Keyboard
        - Mouse
        - Scanner
        - Microphone

  2. Output Devices
      Output devices display or present the processed data from the computer.
        
      Examples of Output Devices:
          - Monitor
          - Printer
          - Speakers

  3. Processing Unit
      The processing unit is the brain of the computer, responsible for executing instructions.
      
      Key Components of the Processing Unit:
          - CPU (Central Processing Unit)
          - GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)


  4. Storage Devices
      Storage devices are used to save data and files for future use.
      
      Examples of Storage Devices:
          - Hard Disk Drive (HDD)
          - Solid State Drive (SSD)
          - USB Flash Drive
          - Memory Cards


  5. Network Components
      Network components allow computers to connect and communicate with each other.
      
      Examples of Network Components:
          - Network Interface Card (NIC)
          - Router
          - Switch
